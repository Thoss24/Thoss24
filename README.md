# Hi there ! :wave:

## About me
Hi my name is Tom, since June 2022 I have been teaching myself how to code using mostly free online resources, with a focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have been having a lot of fun building projects and continue to work on improving my knowledge every day.

In the last couple of months or so I have shifted my focus towards learning react and have been loving it so far!
I am currently still building projects everyday and trying to develop my skills as much as I can with the aim of becoming a front-end developer one day!
If you wish to get in contact with me you can find a link to my Linkedin below.
