# Hi there ! :wave:

## About me
Hi my name is Tom, since June 2022 I have been teaching myself how to code using mostly free online resources, with a focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I have been having a lot of fun building projects and continue to work on improving my knowledge every day.

I am still at the very early stages of learning but if you want to contact me, you can find the link to my Linkedin below
